                <p>
                    At first glance a mechanical keyboard looks like an ordinary membrane keyboard that is used alongside with most 
                    PCs.</br>
                    Although, they have the same functionality and both will allow the user to complete their task 
                    (input information to the computer).</br> Mechanical Keyboards typing experience outclass both membranes
                    and rubber domes, due to their quality of parts.</br>  
                </p>
               <h2>Main Key Differences Between Membrane and Mechanical keyboards</h2>
                <p> 
                    Membrane keyboards has thin membranes that presses on a circuit layer, that registers the key pressed. </br>
                    They are generally more cheaper and quieter than mechanical keyboards. </br>
                    But, they also feel very mushy and unpleasant to type on with a much shorter lifespan.</br>
                    Mechanical keyboards, uses spring-loaded switches instead and they are very customizable,</br> for example;
                    the user can pick the differences of switches, springs, keycaps, and
                    many more. </br>Here is a video explaining in depth why would you want to use Mechanical keyboard:
